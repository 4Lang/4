# 🍀

🍀 is a programming language made entirely of emoji.

...We're not exactly sure what it's going to be used for, yet.

## Final Goals
Optimally we want to have a full compiler and optimized text editing for mobile and desktop.

## Current Work
* More sample code
* A formal language specification

## Contributing

Most development goes on in the IRC channel on [Rizon](http://rizon.net), on the ```#🍀``` channel.
